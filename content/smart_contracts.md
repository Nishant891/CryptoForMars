# Smart Contracts: Overview, Legal Status, and Applications

A **smart contract** is a self-executing program or transaction protocol that automatically enforces, controls, or records the terms of a contract or agreement. The primary goal of smart contracts is to reduce the need for intermediaries, minimize arbitration costs, prevent fraud, and mitigate both accidental and malicious exceptions. They are commonly associated with **cryptocurrencies**, with the **Ethereum smart contracts** serving as the foundational technology for **decentralized finance (DeFi)** and **non-fungible token (NFT)** applications.

## History and Concept

The concept of smart contracts was introduced by **Nick Szabo** in 1994, who envisioned contracts that would be enforced by physical property (e.g., hardware or software) instead of traditional legal systems. He used **vending machines** as an example. In 2014, **Vitalik Buterin**'s Ethereum white paper built upon Szabo’s idea, proposing a more advanced, **Turing-complete smart contract** language called **Solidity**, which expanded the possibilities of smart contracts far beyond what Bitcoin’s simpler scripting language could achieve.

While often confused with traditional **smart legal contracts** (which are legally binding agreements implemented in machine-readable code), smart contracts should not be regarded as legally binding agreements in themselves, but rather as **transaction protocols** executed automatically by code. 

## Legal Status

Smart contracts do not typically constitute legally binding agreements. They are transactions automatically executed by a computer program, often involving cryptocurrency or tokens. Though **legal scholars** have debated the enforceability of smart contracts, most agree that their structure and the nature of programming languages would influence their legal standing.

The US **National Institute of Standards and Technology** defines smart contracts as "a collection of code and data deployed via cryptographically signed transactions on a blockchain." In this interpretation, smart contracts can be thought of as **secured stored procedures** that execute specific tasks, like transferring tokens between parties, without requiring intervention from a centralized authority.

While **smart contracts** are increasingly recognized, some jurisdictions (such as **Arizona**, **Nevada**, and **Wyoming**) have passed laws explicitly supporting their use. For example, in **April 2021**, the **UK Jurisdiction Taskforce** published guidelines for resolving **blockchain-related legal disputes**.

## How Smart Contracts Work

Smart contracts function on blockchains by deploying a transaction that includes the contract's code and is then added to a blockchain block. The decentralized nature of the blockchain, supported by **Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithms**, ensures the contract remains secure and tamper-proof. Once deployed, smart contracts cannot be modified. These contracts can store data, execute computations, and interact with other smart contracts, facilitating processes such as cryptocurrency transfers.

Ethereum is the most popular platform for running smart contracts, and its native language, **Solidity**, is commonly used to write them. However, other languages such as **Vyper** and **Simplicity** have been developed to avoid some of the risks associated with Turing-completeness (e.g., the **halting problem**).

### Notable Blockchain Platforms Supporting Smart Contracts
- **Ethereum**: Uses a Turing-complete language (Solidity) for general-purpose smart contracts.
- **Bitcoin**: Uses a simpler, Turing-incomplete scripting language.
- **Cardano**, **Solana**, **Tron**, and **Tezos**: Support smart contracts with their own platforms and features.

## Applications of Smart Contracts

Smart contracts can be applied in various sectors:

- **Finance**: Smart contracts automate financial transactions, including the creation of self-paying instruments such as **smart bonds**.
- **Real Estate**: They facilitate **property transfers** and title management.
- **Employment**: Smart contracts are proposed for automating **temporary employment contracts**.
- **Inheritance**: They could execute inheritance wishes automatically upon verification of a death certificate.
- **Lotteries and Casinos**: Blockchain technology enhances the transparency and fairness of these applications, utilizing randomness techniques for verifiable results.

## Security Concerns

While smart contracts offer a tamper-proof mechanism for executing transactions, they also have vulnerabilities. Bugs and security flaws in the contract’s code are visible to the entire blockchain network, and fixing them can be difficult. One high-profile example of a smart contract vulnerability was the **DAO hack in 2016**, where an attacker drained approximately $50 million in Ether due to a flaw in the smart contract code.

Other incidents, like the **Parity multisignature wallet** attacks and an **integer overflow attack** in 2018, highlighted the risks of exploiting bugs in smart contract code. These incidents also underscore the importance of formal verification methods to ensure contract security.

## Smart Legal Contracts vs. Smart Contracts

It’s important to distinguish **smart contracts** from **smart legal contracts**. A smart legal contract incorporates traditional legal terms but is implemented in machine-readable code, ensuring that the terms are enforceable in a court of law. In contrast, a smart contract executes automatically according to the program’s code, but may not be enforceable by legal authorities.

Some experts suggest that a **Ricardian contract**, a type of **smart legal contract**, might bridge the gap between code-based execution and legal enforceability.

## Conclusion

Smart contracts have the potential to revolutionize various industries by automating agreements and transactions without the need for intermediaries. However, legal and security challenges remain, requiring further development in contract law and programming practices. As blockchain technology evolves, smart contracts will likely play an even larger role in decentralized applications and cross-industry automation.
