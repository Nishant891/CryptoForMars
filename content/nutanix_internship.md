# How I Cracked An Internship At Nutanix During My 3rd Year 

Nutanix visited Techno India in July this year to recruit interns for the role of Software Reliability Engineer (SRE). Representing Siliguri Institute of Technology, I participated in this recruitment drive. I was fortunate to be one of the five students shortlisted for this opportunity. In this blog, I’ll share my experience to help others prepare for similar roles.


The selection process consisted of four rigorous rounds, focusing on the following topics:

- **Computer Networks**
- **Operating Systems**
- **Cloud Computing**
- **Computer Hardware**
- **Virtualization**

This is a non-coding job profile, so DSA questions were not asked.
