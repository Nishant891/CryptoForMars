# How I cracked an internship at Nutanix during my 3rd year 

Nutanix visited Techno India in July this year to recruit interns for the role of Software Reliability Engineer (SRE). I as an student of Siliguri Institute of Technology participated in the drive. I was fortunate to be one of the five students shortlisted for this opportunity. In this blog, I’ll share my experience to help others prepare for similar roles.

The selection process consisted of four rigorous rounds, focusing on the following topics:

- **Computer Networks**
- **Operating Systems**
- **Cloud Computing**
- **Computer Hardware**
- **Virtualization**

This is a non-coding job profile, so DSA questions were not asked.

## Final Round: Behavioral and Logical Interview

This was the most challenging round for me. It focused on psychological, behavioral, and logical questions. The interviewer also explored my resume in detail, especially my development projects.

**Key Questions:**
1. Introduce yourself and explain why you want to join Nutanix.
2. You have development projects on your resume. Are you more interested in development?
3. What are the four core values of Nutanix? *(Pay close attention during the pre-placement talk for such details.)*
4. Your scooty breaks down. How would you troubleshoot it?
5. Assume I’m a client with a system issue. How would you approach and troubleshoot it?
6. Have you ever held a leadership position?
7. Did you have any prior experience with virtualization?

Additional topics included:
- Hyperconvergence
- Hybrid Cloud
- Edge Computing
- Troubleshooting strategies

The interviewer’s demeanor was both challenging and encouraging. While he expressed dissatisfaction with some answers, he also acknowledged a few as “fair enough.”

> **Preparation Tip**: Learn about Nutanix’s core technologies specially hyperconvergence from their [official website](https://www.nutanix.com/).
> For Cloud Computing, I recommend referring to resources like [Tutorials point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cloud_computing/cloud_computing_tutorial.pdf/).
